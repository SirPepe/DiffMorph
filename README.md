# DiffMorph

## Language support

### Tier 1

Languages in Tier 1 are priority languages with the best support that DiffMorph
can possibly deliver:

* **JSON:** regular old JSON
* **JSONC:** JSON with optional line and block comments
* **HTML:** any flavour of HTML except XHTML (use XML for XHTML)
* **XML:** XML (with namespaces, CDATA sections, xml declarations and more)

### Tier 2

Languages in Tier 2 are somewhat supported by DiffMorph and should work well
enough for most use cases. This list includes several "languages" that are
themselves not very well defined (eg. CLI syntax)

### Tier 3
