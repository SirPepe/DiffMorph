# DiffMorph

## Language support

### Tier 1

Languages in Tier 1 are priority languages with the best support that DiffMorph
can possibly deliver:

* **JSON:** regular old JSON
* **JSONC:** JSON with optional line and block comments
* **HTML:** any flavour of HTML, including XHTML
* **XML:** XML with namespaces, CDATA sections, xml declarations and more. The
  feature set for XML is actually supported by the HTML implementation, so
  you can use namespaces, CDATA sections etc. in either language.

### Tier 2

Languages in Tier 2 are somewhat supported by DiffMorph and should work well
enough for most use cases. This list includes several "languages" that are
themselves not very well defined (eg. CLI syntax)

### Tier 3
